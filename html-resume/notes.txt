Use this to generate/work-on pdf-resume:

A relatively up to date html to pdf converter:
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-to-pdf

A live HTML to PDF converter would be great
Should be just like every other basic online editor/runner, split screen 50/50, left is the editor, right is the pdf
And add an option to save each file, the raw HTML and the resulting PDF
